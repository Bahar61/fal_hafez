# fal_hafez

An application that generates random poems from Hafez in English and Farsi. 
I used Python and Flask framework. I send live requests and scrape hafizonlove website using Beautiful soup to generate random poems and use Jinja to render results to the HTML page for users to read. I parsed unicode whitespace characters to ensure that the poems were properly formatted for users in both English and Farsi.
